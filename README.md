What is a heap?

A heap is a data structure type in the form of a binary tree in which each tree node has a minimum of two children

Advantages of a heap:

Space efficiency: heap only requires a small amount of memory to store and manage a large amount of data. The space efficiency of a heap is achieved by organizing the data in a specific way, which allows for quick and easy access to the data when needed. This makes the heap an ideal data structure for applications that require fast and efficient data access while minimizing memory usage.
Guaranteed access to the maximum or minimum element: In heaps, ensures that you can obtain the extreme values without any guesswork or ambiguity, which can be particularly useful in data analysis, mathematical modeling, and programming. With guaranteed access to the maximum or minimum element, you can achieve more accurate and efficient results, avoid errors and inconsistencies, and make informed decisions based on objective criteria.

Disadvantages of a heap:
Lack of flexibility: Using heaps is that they have limited flexibility compared to other data structures, such as linked lists or arrays. This can make it difficult to perform certain operations or modify the data in the heap. Therefore, it's important to carefully consider the advantages and disadvantages of using heaps when choosing a data structure for a particular task.
Not ideal for searching: When data is stored in heaps, it is not an efficient method for searching. In heaps, data is not arranged in a specific order, which makes it challenging to locate a particular value quickly. To find a value in a heap, the algorithm needs to traverse through all the nodes in the heap, which results in a significant amount of time complexity. Therefore, heaps are not an ideal data structure for search operations.

Properties of a heap:

Heaps allow for quick access to the top element, which is always the maximum or minimum value depending on whether it is a max-heap or min-heap. Heaps are for optimizing algorithms and improving performance in a variety of applications.
A heap is a specialized data structure used for sorting and organizing data efficiently. It is a tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property which means that the value of each parent node is either greater than or equal to the value of its child node in a max heap or smaller than or equal to the value of its child node in a min heap. The heap data structure is useful for implementing algorithms like heap sort, priority queues, and graph algorithms.

Accessing items in a heap:

The function Headpush() allows you to add items to a heap data structure. You just need to pass the items as an argument to this function.
Removing items from a heap:

"Heappop()" is a function used to remove and return the smallest item from a heap.
